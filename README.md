# SimpleBlog (0.1)

A basic blog engine built with Java and Spring MVC.

Supports markdown syntax and pretty coloring of code blocks.

This project is still in an early stage of development.

Working:

1. It shows blog messages from the database.
2. A user can navigate between blog posts.
3. Syntax coloring of code blocks.
4. You can log in and post / edit new items.

Todo's:

1. User registration.
2. Archive view with search functionality.
3. Much more :-)
